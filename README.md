# Diabetes Prediction Using Machine Learning

Overview
This project aims to predict the onset of diabetes in patients using machine learning techniques, specifically Support Vector Machines (SVM). The dataset used for this project contains various biomedical measurements, such as glucose level, blood pressure, and body mass index (BMI), collected from patients. By analyzing these features, we can build a predictive model to identify individuals at risk of developing diabetes.

# Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/liltims77/Diabetes_prediction_using_Machine_learning/diabetes-prediction.git

# Dataset
The dataset used in this project is available in the data directory. You can find more information about the dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/akshaydattatraykhare/diabetes-dataset).

# Models
We use Support Vector Machines (SVM) for building the predictive model. SVM is a powerful machine learning algorithm that is effective in classification tasks. You can explore different SVM configurations and kernel functions in the models.py file.

# Evaluation
We evaluate the performance of the model using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The evaluation results are displayed in the console when you run the project. You can further analyze the performance by visualizing the results using tools like [mention any visualization libraries you've used].
